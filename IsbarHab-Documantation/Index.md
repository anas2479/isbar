# The Why: Problem 
Too often, the Somali population is challenged by a language barrier. In a world where technology is attuned to English speakers, where accessibility tools such as text-to-speech work best with English, that language barrier becomes silent a STEM Justice inequality. 

Bright minds who could be contributing to an increasingly technologically advancing world are sadly discouraged and made to feel as though STEM isn't for them simply because they don't speak English well nor see themselves a lot in STEM.

# Solution: 
We plan to use technology itself, to address this STEM Inequity. We do this by building educational tools that reduce the language barrier and make English more accessible to the Somali population. 
Then, we further extend those tools to make technology more accessible. 

# Opportunity 
## Audience
-  ~ 6 Million : the Somali population is ~ 15 million, almost half of whom are under 15.   So for now, I'm targeting 6 million of them. 
- 86,610 of those live in Minnesota alone.
