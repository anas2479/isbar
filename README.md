# Isbar (To Educate One's Self)

The Ibar project is a Somali-native web app to teach Somali immigrants how to speak English.
Its design and function are inspired by successful language learning apps such as Duolingo.

## The Why
Often, new and older-generation Somalian immigrants face a language barrier. This barrier creates all kinds of challenges, such as the ability to get a job to sustain one's livelihood. It makes it challenging to function in a society where English is primarily used for everything.

Moreover, I believe that a barrier to language creates a barrier to technology. If you are having difficulty speaking the language,  then imagine what your experience would be like in a world where technology is attuned for English speakers and accessibility tools such as text-to-voice assume you know English. And even when technology tries to include other languages, Somali is often absent from those languages.

I see this STEM Justice issue and have gotten a taste of some of the experiences I’ve defined as a Somalian immigrant myself. With this project, we don’t seek to change the world or systems that have been in place for millennia, instead, we seek to help the individuals subjected to those systems.

### Tech Stack
- Svelte: The framework powering the entire app.
- Tailwind: The CSS framework behind the delightful but simple design of the app.
- GSAP: The Animation library behind the subtle movements. 

*To the developers of the above technologies, thank you for saving my sanity.*
